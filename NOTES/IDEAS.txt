People can learn more about a subject by exploring related subjects in a
knowledge graph. Personalized knowledge graphs can be created via LLMs.

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH DB
- create a DB of subjects and related subjects
- each related subject should have a relevance/distance score
- start with a set of the most general subjects and keep following related 
    subjects until you reach a specific depth
- only explore each subject's related subjects once to avoid over exploration of 
    any one subject
- create a way to explore general subjects vs. specific subjects
